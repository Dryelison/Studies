This JavaScript code requests the tourist's name and then asks the tourist to report whether they have visited any city. If the tourist answers "Yes", the code will ask for the name of the city visited repeatedly until the tourist says "No". Then, the code will display a message containing the tourist's name, the number of cities visited and a list of cities visited.
